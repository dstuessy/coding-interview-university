# How registers and RAM work

## Looped circuits 

### Looped OR gate

```
A ---|OR|_C___ 
B ---|__| |
   |______|
```

This circuit permanently sets its output to `1` once either `A` or `B`
are `1`. Explained: the `C` will be `1` if either `A` or `B` is `1`.
Once `C` is `1`, `B` is `1`, therefore the output is `1`. This is 
permanent.

These are useful to persist a value of `1`.

### Looped AND gate

```
A ---|AND|_C___ 
B ---|___| |
   |_______|
```

This doesn't have the same degree of permanency as a looped OR gate.
`C` will only be `1` if both `A` and `B` are `1`. Now... there's
a loop hole. That once `C` is `1`, `B` will be `1`, therefore as long
as `A` remains `1` after `C` is `1`, `C` will be `1` if `B` is `0`.

These are useful to persist a value of `0`.

### AND-OR latch

This takes us to the AND-OR latch. These are made by combining a 
looped OR gate and a looped AND gate.

```    ________________________
       |                      |
       --|OR|----------|AND|__|___ OUTPUT
SET -----|__| |NOT|----|___| 
RESET --------|___|
```

In this circuit there are two inputs. `SET` and `RESET` -- the former
is to set a value, the latter is to clear it. The `OR` and `AND` gates
work together to keep a `1` stored when `SET` is `1`. Then to clear it
if `RESET` is `1`. 

The way this works is that if `SET` is `1`, the `OR` will emit `1`.
The `AND` will then receive this and if `RESET` is `0`, the `AND` will
have two `1`s (this is thanks to the `NOT` gate, flipping the `RESET`
value), making the output `1`. Then the loop back will supply the `OR`
with `1` again, permanently storing the `1`, even if `SET` is `0`.
Now. If `RESET` is `1`, the `AND` will receive `0` (again, thanks to
`NOT`) and a `1`. This sets the loop back to `0`, which in turn sets
the output to `0`.

Basically, store a `1` or a `0`.

### Gated latch

Using two wires to store a `1` or a `0` is inconvenient. For this
reason a more abstracted circuit called a gated latch is used. Instead
it requires a data input and write enable signal.

```
                          ________________________
                          |                      |
DATA                      --|OR|                 |
INPUT ------|-------|AND|---|__|\                |
        ____รง_______|___|        \               |
        |   |_|NOT|               -----|AND|_____|_____ OUTPUT
WRITE   |     |___|----|AND|--|NOT|----|___|
ENABLE ----------------|___|  |___|
```

Here the data input can either be `0` or `1`. Whether or not the value
is stored by the latch depends on if the write enable signal is `1`
or `0`.

For example, a `1` will only be stored because the latch has an `AND`
for both `DATA INPUT` and `WRITE ENABLE`.

A `0` is also stored due to the `AND` that precedes the `OR` of the
latch. This gives it a `0` to turn off, but if the latch has a `1` in
it's loop, the `OR` will remain with a `1`. To reset the loop to `0`,
the `AND` in the latch must be given a `0`, which is provided by the
preceding `NOT`, and an `AND` that connects to `WRITE ENABLE` as well
as a `NOT` that connects to `DATA INPUT`. 

So. If `DATA INPUT` is `0` and `WRITE ENABLE` is `1`, the latch will
receive a `0` at the `OR`. The second `AND` before the latch will be
`1` because it receives a `1` from `WRITE ENABLE` and `DATA INPUT` 
and its `NOT`. The following `NOT` then gives the latch's `AND` a `0`,
setting both the latch's `OR` and `AND` to `0`, making `OUTPUT` `0`.

Now. If `DATA INPUT` is `0` and `WRITE ENABLE` `0`, the latch will
receive a `0` at its `OR`. The second `AND` before the latch will be
`0` because it receives a `0` from `WRITE ENABLE` and a `1` from
`DATA INPUT` and its `NOT`. The following `NOT` gives the
latch's `AND` a `1`, setting both the latch's `OR` and `AND` to `1`,
making `OUTPUT` `1`.

Basically, turn on `WRITE ENABLE` to set the value of the gated latch
as the value of `DATA INPUT`.

## Registers

A group of latches is called a Register. Each latch stores one bit, 
therefore a register can hold 8 for 8-bit, or 16 for 16-bit.
The number of bits in a register is called its width, used to store
a single number. Most modern day computers have registers that are
64-bits wide.

So. Storing a number in a register is done by having all
`WRITE ENABLE` inputs wired together. That way only one wire is 
required to enable all of its gated latches. Then `DATA INPUT` wires
for the gated latches are used individually to write a bit of data
into each.

For small registers, these latches can be arranged in series. However,
modern 64-bit registers would need 64 wires for `DATA INPUT` and
64 wires for `OUTPUT`, only one wire for `WRITE ENABLE`, making a
total of 129 wires. And then for 256-bits, 513 wires.
This adds up a lot.

To reduce the number of wires used, a matrix can be used. In this
configuration, latches are arranged in a grid, with 16x16 latches 
for a 256-bit register. Columns and rows of wires are then used to
to activate the latches. Basically as an _(x, y)_ coordinate system.

Here's how a latch looks in within a matrix.

```

   |        |                                                                                            
   |        |   DATA IN/OUT ----------|------------------|                                                  
   |        |                         |___|GATED|        |
   |        |                             |LATCH|----|T|_|
   |        |   WRITE ENABLE ---|AND|_____|_____|    |_|
   |        |           ________|___|                 |
   |        --|AND|____/                              |
   |----------|___|    \________________|AND|_________|
   |     READ ENABLE -------------------|___|
```

In this configuration, only two wires are needed for `DATA INPUT`,
`OUTPUT` and `WRITE ENABLE`. One for both `DATA IN/OUT`, another for
`WRITE ENABLE`. The latter will only activate if both the wires for
the column and the row are active. This is due to the first `AND` to
the left of the diagram, connected to both the column and row wires.
This `AND` leads to two other `AND`s for `WRITE ENABLE` and
`READ ENABLE`. These won't turn `1` unless both the coordinate wires
are active and `WRITE ENABLE` or `READ ENABLE` are `1`. These then 
lead to their respective inputs or outputs of the `GATED LATCH`,
either reading or writing data.

To address a latch, an address is used... Go figure... These are
fed to a multiplexer as binary numbers such as 1000 for 8 or 1100
for 12. The multiplexer will then activate the corresponding columns
and rows.

## Memory

A matrix of latches can be abstracted to 256-bit memory with an 8-bit
address, `WRITE ENABLE` and `READ ENABLE` wires, and finally one
`DATA` wire for input or output.

```
           ______________________

READ       |                    |
ENABLE  ---|____________________|
```

To store more useful amounts of memory, we can arrange them in a row
of eight.

```  
            |M| |M| |M| |M| |M| |M| |M| |M|
        ======----   |   |   |   |   |   |
8-bit   ==============----   |   |   |   |
ADDRESS ======================----   |   |
        ==============================----
             ||| ||| ||| ||| ||| ||| ||| |||
WRITE        ||| ||| ||| ||| ||| ||| ||| |||
ENABLE -----------------------------------||
              ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||
READ          ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||
ENABLE ------------------------------------|
               |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
               -----------------------------
                             |
                        8-bit DATA

NOTE: due to ASCII limitations, it may look like WRITE ENABLE,
READ ENABLE, and 8-bit DATA are joined. These are not. They overlap
each other.
```

Storing 8-bits of data (a byte), sends one bit to each memory unit
at the same address with the signal to `WRITE ENABLE`. Reading works
the same but with `READ ENABLE`.

Such a series of memory units with shared addresses can be referred
to as Random-Access Memory (RAM). It's called this because memory
can be accessed at any time in any order from any address. The
specific example here, though, is called Static Random-Access Memory
(SRAM), which is built out of latches. There are other types such as
DRAM, Flash Memory, and NVRAM. They are all similar in function to
SRAM, but use different components to store individual bits, such as
different logic gates, capacitors, charge traps, or memristors. 
They all store bits of memory in matrices of memory cells, though.
